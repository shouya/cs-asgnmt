# Computer Science Assignment
## Brief Introduction
Here's my computer science subject assignments. The purpose of this
repository is basically:
* keep my works from losing them and manage them easily
* version control, keep all changes visible
* open up to students like me
* show off my perfect codes, since assignments are mostly simple that
  could be kept its perfection
* submit to the teacher quickly and he can read the code directly on
  github

## Directory Arranging
All directory are arranged in date-tree's form, i.e.:
`/year/month/date/project-name/`

* *Year*s are 4-digit numbers (2012, 2013, ...)
* *Month*s are 3-character month name abbreviation (jan..dec)
* *Date*s are sometimes neglected. It should be in form of 2-digit
   number representation of the day-of-the-month (0..(28|29|30|31))
* *Project name*s are optional. If there's more than one
   projects in one day, put them into different directories with
   meaningful names

## Source Code
My code is written in Java & Revo. Java is the main teaching language
of computer science subject in my pre-university, and beside Revo is a
lisp dialect invented and implemented by me; the syntax is mostly
compatible with scheme. You can acquire the interpreter from:
https://github.com/shouya/revo

My target is to write self-commented code so I rarely write comment in
source code to explain things. Just read them, you'll find it easy,
<del>my code is perfect</del>.
